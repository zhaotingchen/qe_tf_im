# A quadratic estimator view of the transfer function correction in intensity mapping surveys

This page holds the code for generating the simulations and numerical calculations of quadratic estimator window function used for [Chen 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13070). See `func.py` for generating the mock realisations and `run.ipynb` for generating the figures used in the paper.

The underlying tool for generating the simulations is `meer21cm`, which is currently only available to MeerKLASS members. The package will be publically available soon.
